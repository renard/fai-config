# LOGUSER: an account on the install server which saves all log-files
# and which can change the kernel that is booted via network.
# Configure .rhosts for this account and PAM, so that root can log in
# from all install clients without password. This account should have
# write permissions for /srv/tftp/fai. For example, you can use write
# permissions for the group linuxadm. chgrp linuxadm /srv/tftp/fai;chmod
# g+w /srv/tftp/fai. If the variable is undefined, this feature is disabled.
# Define it, to enable it, eg. LOGUSER=fai
